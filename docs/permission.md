# Identity and Access Management

An Identity and Access Management (IAM) system allows fine grained control of
access to a system. It is commonly used in large corporations for tiered access
to sensitive resounces. For instance, AWS and Google Cloud platforms provide an
IAM system to control access to cloud resources such as compute engines and
databases. We by no means want to implement one. However, we can use
some concepts from IAM systems to build an extensible permission system for
out app.

# User

A user is exactly what you think it is. A single person with a unique email and
password. It really doesn't get any more complicated than that.

# Permission

# Role

# Resource
